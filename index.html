            The human species has evolved to become the most dominant species
            on the planet, and populates almost 100% of the globe as well as
            being the top of the food chain in all ecosystems. However, we are
            not the strongest or the fastest, so how is it that we have become 
            such a dominant force on the planet earth? even more so than the dinosaurs
            of old and the sharks that rule the sea after our relatively short existance
            <br><br>
            We humans have one aspect that sets us apart from almost all animals on the planet,
            and that is our brain. The human brain is able to solve complex problems and 
            adapt to almost every situation it encounters, however it does have its drawbacks. 
            A large brain like ours requires vast amounts of energy to function, grow and learn.
            <br><br>
            This page will be underlining some of the theories proposed as to why we, as a 
            species have been able to develop our great levels of intelligence and begin to 
            conquer the world since our species first began to evolve around 2 million years ago.

            The Stoned Ape
        </h2>

        <img src="assets/images/amanita.jpeg" id="mushroom" class="img"
        alt="red with white spotted fly agaric mushroom containing psychoactive chemicals">
        <p>
           This theory was brought about by Dennis McKenna. He believed that when early humanids
           left the trees becoming bipedal, their food choices were expanded as they hunted animals
           and foraged in places that thay had not looked before. This is where, he proposed, that
           humanids were first introduced to the psilocybin (the active chemical in causing visual 
           hallucinations) containing mushrooms
           <br><br>
           McKenna suggested that it was these psilocybin mushrooms were the trigger to humans to rapidly develop
           and organise their information- processing, leading to the tripling in mass of the brain in the
           2 million years we have existed. Causing the differentiation from our acnestors, Homo Erectus.
           <br><br>
           these 'magic mushrooms' were not only thought to be the starting point in the evolution of the 
           modern day human, but the cause behind the cuntinual development of the human intelligence up 
           untill modern day. psilocybin mushrooms are most commonly found around animal dung, meaning that when
           humans began to farm animals for ther produce, these mushrooms were much more readily available and 
           were eventually encorporated into religeous practices and rituals, leading to the religeons that exist today.

            The Use of Tools
        </h2>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/images/stone tool.jpeg" id="stone-tool"
        class="img" alt="stone axe resting on a rock">
        <p>
            While not completely unique to humans, tools have been a core part of our evolution. Our use of early tools
            such as the hand axes, spears, cutting tools, and arrows have propelled us in the evolutionary race. Due to
            the evolution of the opposing thumb in apes, humans and other apes are able to have a much greater dexterity and 
            control wnen it comes to precise movements and actions with our hands. This ability and the relatively high intelligence
            possesed by early humans allowed us to create tools from the environment around us, form flints, wood and bone.
            these tools allowed early humans to have a huge amount of success when it came to hunting and accesing food,
            as we were able to make up for any lacking in offensive power with piercing weapons and blunt force. 
            <br><br>
            This constructive weaponry would allow us as humans to provide energy for our rapidly developing and growing brains
            leading to ever greater advancements in technology, such as the bow and arrow for example. it was tools like these
            that allowed humans to hunt and gather in safety, being able to take down dnagerous prey at a range and deending
            against attackers. this overall would lead to a massive increace in the population of the early huamn, boosting them 
            to the top of almost every food chain.

            Running Man

        <br>
        <img src="assets/images/runner.jpeg" id="running-man"
        class="img" alt="female runner running in the mountains">
        <p>
            We humans are no means the quickest, strongest or most agile of creatures, in fact we are probably out done by most
            animals that we would encounter in at least one of these aspects and usually more. So why is it that we were able, 
            despite our weak physical appearence, able to hunt and kill animals many times our size?
            <br><br>
            The reason behind this is that we are designed purely for endurance. Being bipedal meant that we were able to travel 
            large distances without stopping or slowing down. Due to our upright nature, we are able to supply constant oxygen to 
            our vital organs and muscles without it being impeded when we are running. Quadrupeds however, when running, their
            are forced aginst their ribcage, reducing oxygen capcity and preventing them from being able to cool down. 
            Taking this factor into account, our ancestors were able to apply a relentless advance towards the animal,
            preventing it from stopping to pant and unable to cool down, eventually leading to its capture.
            <br><br>
            It was with this technique that we were able to combat the ice age beasts such as the bison, wooly mammoth, and the wooly 
            rhino. With this ability, we were able to provide the energy required for our intelligence to develop.
