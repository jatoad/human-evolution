            The human species has evolved to become the most dominant species
            on the planet, and populates almost 100% of the globe as well as
            being the top of the food chain in all ecosystems. However, we are
            not the strongest or the fastest, so how is it that we have become 
            such a dominant force on the planet earth? even more so than the dinosaurs
            of old and the sharks that rule the sea after our relatively short existance
            <br><br>
            We humans have one aspect that sets us apart from almost all animals on the planet,
            and that is our brain. The human brain is able to solve complex problems and 
            adapt to almost every situation it encounters, however it does have its drawbacks. 
            A large brain like ours requires vast amounts of energy to function, grow and learn.
            <br><br>
            This page will be underlining some of the theories proposed as to why we, as a 
            species have been able to develop our great levels of intelligence and begin to 
            conquer the world since our species first began to evolve around 2 million years ago.
