## - Features

### - Nav Bar

![screen shot of nav bar and to top button](/assets/images/nav.png)
- The navigation bar contains the links to take the reader to each section of the page. when hovered over by the mouse, the background darkens slightly so that the user is aware that it is a link. i also added a button that brings the user to the top. this button is fixed in position so that it can be used at any time meaning that the user does not have to spend time scrolling and looking for a section. 

### - Background

![screen shot of website background](/assets/images/background.png)
- This background adds character to the page, but does not distract from the information as it is not brightly colored 
and contrasting colors were chosen to prevent struggle when reading. background is stationary so that movement on the screen is reduced, to avoid distracting th euser from the targeted content.

### - Content Sections
